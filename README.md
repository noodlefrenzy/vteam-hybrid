# Project Name

> Replace this README with your project's README after scaffolding.

## Quick Start

2. Run a scaffold command to set up your tech stack:
   - `/project:scaffold-cli` — CLI tool
   - `/project:scaffold-web-monorepo` — Web/mobile monorepo
   - `/project:scaffold-ai-tool` — AI/data-centric tool
   - `/project:scaffold-static-site` — Static site
3. Run `/project:kickoff` to start discovery
4. Start building with `/project:tdd <feature>`

## What's Included

This template provides **vteam-hybrid** — a virtual development team with 18 agent personas, a 7-phase hybrid methodology, and 21+ workflow commands for the full development lifecycle.
