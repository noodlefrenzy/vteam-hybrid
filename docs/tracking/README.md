# Phase Tracking Artifacts

This directory holds lightweight tracking artifacts that capture decisions and state at each workflow phase. They create an audit trail and enable cross-session continuity.

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-<phase>.md
```

**Phases:** `discovery`, `architecture`, `plan`, `implementation`, `review`, `debug`

**Examples:**
- `2026-02-16-auth-system-discovery.md`
- `2026-02-16-auth-system-architecture.md`
- `2026-02-17-auth-system-plan.md`

## Artifact Format

Every tracking artifact follows this structure (~20 lines, not exhaustive research docs):

```markdown
---
agent-notes: { ctx: "<phase> tracking for <topic>", deps: [...], state: active, last: "<agent>@<date>" }
---

# <Phase>: <Topic>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Lead:** <agent>
**Status:** Active | Complete | Blocked
**Prior Phase:** <link or "None">

## Key Decisions
<!-- Record every non-trivial implementation choice made during this phase.
     Include: what was chosen, what was rejected, and why.
     These entries are the primary record for decisions too small for a full ADR.
     Format: "Chose X over Y because Z" — one line each, be specific. -->

## When Artifacts Are Produced

| Command | Phase | Trigger |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/kickoff` Phase 1 | `discovery` | After vision elicitation checkpoint |
| `/kickoff` Phase 3 | `architecture` | After architecture assessment checkpoint |
| `/kickoff` Phase 5 | `plan` | After planning checkpoint |
| `/plan` | `plan` | After plan document is written |
| `/tdd` | `implementation` | After TDD work is complete |
| `/code-review` | `review` | After review findings are compiled |

Phases 2 and 4 of kickoff are intermediate — their output folds into the adjacent phase artifacts.

## Lifecycle

1. **Created** during the relevant workflow phase with status `Active`
2. **Updated** if the phase revisits decisions (status stays `Active`)
3. **Completed** when the next phase begins (status → `Complete`)
4. **Archived** at sprint boundary — moved to `docs/tracking/archive/sprint-N/`

## Cross-Session Continuity

- `/handoff` references the latest tracking artifacts so the next session has phase context
- `/resume` can read tracking artifacts to reconstruct where a multi-phase workflow left off
- Each artifact links to its **Prior Phase** artifact, creating a navigable chain

## Key Decisions Are the Micro-Decision Record

The **Key Decisions** section in each tracking artifact is the primary record for decisions that are too small for a full ADR but too valuable to lose. This is where implementation choices, accepted trade-offs, adopted patterns, and acknowledged risks get captured.

**Write them as "Chose X over Y because Z"** — specific, searchable, and useful to a future session encountering the same code. Examples:

- "Chose `Map` over plain `Object` for the cache because deletion performance matters for expire-on-access."
- "Accepted Vik's complexity flag on `transform()` because extracting it would split a tight coupling."
- "Went with property-based testing for the parser because the input space is combinatorial."

At sprint boundary, if a Key Decision reveals architectural significance, promote it to an ADR.

## Design Rationale

- **`docs/tracking/`** not `.copilot-tracking/` — artifacts are committed to the repo as an audit trail
- **No forced `/clear`** — our phases nest and interleave; artifacts are additive context, not replacements
- **Lightweight format** — ~20 lines per artifact, summaries not exhaustive research
- **Archive at sprint boundary** — prevents the tracking directory from growing unbounded
- **Prior Phase links** — each artifact links backward, creating a decision chain
- **Key Decisions as micro-decision record** — fills the gap between full ADRs and no record at all
