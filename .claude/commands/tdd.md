Implement the following using strict TDD: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this cycle for each piece of behavior:

1. **Red** — Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior. Run the test suite to confirm it fails.
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code to make the test pass. Run the test suite to confirm it passes.
3. **Refactor** — Clean up the implementation while keeping all tests green. Run the test suite after refactoring.

Commit after each green-refactor cycle with a conventional commit message.

Do not write implementation code without a failing test first.

For items sized M or larger, Tara must be invoked as a standalone agent for the Red phase (not inlined by Sato). See `docs/adrs/0002-tdd-workflow.md`.
