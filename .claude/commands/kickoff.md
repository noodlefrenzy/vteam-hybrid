Run a full discovery workflow for: $ARGUMENTS

This is a phased process. Complete each phase and get explicit human confirmation before moving to the next. Reference `docs/team_personas.md` for persona details.

---

## Phase 1: Vision Elicitation (Coach Cam)

Slow down. Do NOT jump to solutions. Your job is to make the human's vision legible — often to themselves for the first time.

- Ask probing questions: "What problem does this solve? For whom? What does success look like? What would make you say this failed?"
- Use the 5 Whys to find root motivations behind surface-level requests.
- Try "what if we did the opposite?" to pressure-test assumptions.
- Surface hidden constraints: timeline, budget, existing systems, skill gaps.
- Propose alternatives the human hasn't considered.

**Checkpoint:** Summarize your understanding of the vision, goals, and constraints. Ask: "Did I get this right? What did I miss?"

**Tracking artifact:** After the human confirms, produce `docs/tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-discovery.md` summarizing the vision, goals, constraints, and key insights from elicitation. Use the standard tracking format from `docs/tracking/README.md`. Set **Prior Phase** to "None".

---

## Phase 2: Sacrificial Concepts (Dani)

Generate 2-3 intentionally different approaches. These are **sacrificial** — designed to provoke reactions, not to be implemented as-is.

- Vary on key dimensions: complexity, user model, technical approach, scope.
- Label each explicitly as sacrificial: "This is meant to be torn apart."
- Present trade-offs for each approach.
- Ask: "Which resonates most? Which do you hate? Why?"

**Checkpoint:** Summarize which direction the human is leaning and why. Confirm before proceeding.

---

## Phase 3: Architecture Assessment (Archie + Pierrot + Wei)

Based on the chosen direction:

- Propose a high-level architecture. Keep it simple — boxes and arrows, not a thesis.
- Identify key technology decisions that need to be made.
- For each significant choice, create an ADR using `/project:adr`.
- Flag risks and unknowns.
- **Threat model:** Archie creates the data flow diagrams, then Pierrot creates the initial threat model at `docs/security/threat-model.md` — STRIDE analysis, trust boundaries, attack surface inventory. This doesn't need to be exhaustive yet; it grows with the system.
- **Performance budget:** If the project has performance-sensitive requirements (user-facing latency, batch processing throughput, resource constraints), create an initial `docs/performance-budget.md` with targets.

### Adversarial Debate (Mandatory for each ADR)

For **every** ADR created in this phase, run the adversarial debate protocol. This is not optional.

1. **Invoke Wei** as a standalone agent on the ADR. Wei challenges the decision using at least 2 techniques from their persona (inversion, scale attack, assumption surfacing, alternative technology, cost of being wrong, historical precedent).
2. **Feed Wei's challenges back to Archie.** Archie must respond point-by-point.
3. **If unresolved concerns remain**, run a third round (Wei rebuttal). Cap at 3 rounds.
4. **Track the debate** in `docs/tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-debate.md` using the format from `docs/process/team-governance.md` § Debate Tracking Format.
5. **Update the ADR** with any changes or acknowledged risks from the debate.

**Do not proceed to Phase 4 until all ADR debates are complete and tracked.**

**Checkpoint:** Summarize architectural direction, key decisions, initial threat surface, and debate outcomes (challenges raised, resolved, accepted as risks). Confirm.

**Tracking artifact:** After the human confirms, produce `docs/tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-architecture.md` summarizing the chosen architecture, key ADRs created, technology decisions, threat surface, and debate results. Use the standard tracking format from `docs/tracking/README.md`. Set **Prior Phase** to the discovery artifact.

---

## Phase 4: Acceptance Criteria (Pat)

Turn the vision into concrete, testable requirements:

- Break the vision into user stories or feature areas.
- Write acceptance criteria for the first milestone.
- Define MVP scope — what's in, what's explicitly out.
- Prioritize ruthlessly. "What's the smallest thing we could ship that would be useful?"

**Checkpoint:** Review the acceptance criteria with the human. Confirm scope.

---

## Phase 5: Planning (Grace + Tara)

Create the implementation plan:

- Create a plan document in `docs/plans/` using `/project:plan`.
- Identify the first sprint's work.
- Note which v-team personas should be actively engaged during implementation.
- Flag any remaining open questions or risks.
- **Test strategy:** Tara creates `docs/test-strategy.md` — what gets tested at which level, coverage targets, test data approach. This guides all future test writing.
- **Tech debt register:** Grace initializes `docs/tech-debt.md` (it will be empty, but the structure is in place for tracking).

**Checkpoint:** Review the plan. Confirm the human is ready to start building.

**Tracking artifact:** After the human confirms, produce `docs/tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md` summarizing the plan goals, first sprint scope, test strategy decisions, and open risks. Use the standard tracking format from `docs/tracking/README.md`. Set **Prior Phase** to the architecture artifact.

### GitHub Project Board Setup (Mandatory)

After the plan is confirmed, create a GitHub Projects board to track the work. This is **not optional** — a project board is required for sprint tracking, backlog sweeps, and retro gating.

#### Step 1: Create and Link the Project

```bash
# Detect repo owner and name
gh repo view --json owner,name

# Create the project
gh project create --title "<project-name>" --owner @me

# Link the project to this repo
gh project link <NUMBER> --owner @me --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

#### Step 2: Configure Status Field (CRITICAL)

GitHub Projects v2 only creates default status options (Todo, In Progress, Done). This project requires **5 statuses**: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done. You MUST add the missing ones.

```bash
# 1. Get the project's node ID and Status field ID
gh project field-list <NUMBER> --owner @me --format json
# Find the "Status" field — note its ID and existing option IDs/names

# 2. Add missing status options via GraphQL
# You need the project ID (from gh project list --owner @me --format json)
# and the Status field ID (from step 1)

# Add "Backlog" option
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation {
    updateProjectV2Field(input: {
      projectId: "<PROJECT_NODE_ID>"
      fieldId: "<STATUS_FIELD_ID>"
      name: "Status"
      singleSelectOptions: [
        {name: "Backlog", color: GRAY, description: "Not yet scheduled"}
        {name: "Ready", color: BLUE, description: "Scheduled for current sprint"}
        {name: "In Progress", color: YELLOW, description: "Actively being worked on"}
        {name: "In Review", color: ORANGE, description: "Implementation done, under review"}
        {name: "Done", color: GREEN, description: "Completed and verified"}
      ]
    }) {
      projectV2Field { ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { options { id name } } }
    }
  }'

# 3. VERIFY all 5 statuses exist
gh project field-list <NUMBER> --owner @me --format json
# Confirm: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done all appear
```

**Do NOT proceed to issue creation until all 5 statuses are confirmed.** If the GraphQL mutation fails, try adding options one at a time or use the GitHub web UI as a fallback — but the statuses MUST exist before any items are added.

#### Step 3: Create Issues and Add to Project

```bash
# Create work items as repo issues (not draft items)
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "sprint:1"   # first sprint
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."                       # backlog

# Add each issue to the project
gh project item-add <NUMBER> --owner @me --url <issue-url>
```

#### Step 4: Set Initial Statuses

After adding items, set their statuses. You need the Status field ID and option IDs from Step 2.

```bash
# Get item IDs
gh project item-list <NUMBER> --owner @me --format json

# Set status for each item
gh project item-edit --project-id <PROJECT_NODE_ID> --id <ITEM_ID> --field-id <STATUS_FIELD_ID> --single-select-option-id <OPTION_ID>
```

- First sprint items → **Ready**
- Everything else → **Backlog**

#### Step 5: Record Board Metadata

Update `CLAUDE.md` GitHub Board section with:
- Project number and owner
- Status field ID (so future commands don't need to look it up)
- Option IDs for each status (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done)

This metadata is required for all subsequent board operations. Without it, every status transition requires a field lookup first.

#### Step 6: Confirm

Report: "Board created and linked to repo with N items. First sprint has M items in Ready. Status field configured with 5 options: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done."
